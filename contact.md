Here are the best ways to contact me.

## for most people

If you do not work in public or media relations, the best way to contact me is to send an email to **`#####@carterpape.com`**. Replace `#####` with [the standard English greeting word](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hello).

## for story and source pitches

If you work in public or media relations and want to contact me, email me at **`?????@arizent.com`**. Replace `?????` with my first name, a period, then my last name.

## for more security

If you want an extra secure means of reaching me, you can use any of the following apps:

* [Signal](https://signal.org) (username: [@carterpape.58](https://signal.me/#eu/2FVnSYq0p9ugwZMS3TJz_SlktsRViVCEnBpCThDH2bPNay1MM7dDuJyYHqCWoHHc))
* [Telegram](https://telegram.org) (username: [carterpape](https://t.me/carterpape))
* [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com) (contact me [here](https://wa.me/qr/IFMGXO6IGV7VJ1))

If you do not trust any of those apps, here's [an OpenPGP public key]({%- link /assets/pages/contact/Carter Pape (E9179A9F) â€“ Public.asc -%}) in RSA format and a promise from me that I am the only person who has the corresponding private key.
