NewsBot was a tool that ran scheduled tasks — chiefly web scraping — to automate some of the more rote parts of my and _The Times-Independent_'s workflows.

Such tasks included gathering and formatting weather data that used in the weekly print edition of the newspaper, checking for updates on [investigations](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/state-probing-frontier-following-service-complaints/) that we followed, looking out for new [oil](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/sand-flats-pulled-from-potential-drilling-sites/) and [gas](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/230-parcels-many-near-arches-canyonlands-up-for-oil-gas-lease-sale/) lease sales in the area, and more.

Each feature I added to NewsBot proved to be a boon to my team's productivity and saved the office time by taking care of some of the routine tasks we typically faced daily or weekly, affording us greater capacity to focus on the more important, less mindless parts of our jobs.
