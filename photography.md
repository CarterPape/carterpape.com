# photography

One facet of working for a newspaper with [fewer than 10 full-time staff members](https://www.moabtimes.com/articles/happy-new-year-from-all-of-us-at-the-times-independent/) is that there were no staff photographers. I and my editor took the bulk of the newspaper's staff-sourced photos; community members, officials, and open license sources provided the rest.

I got my own digital camera only after leaving Moab; I took the news photos here with my iPhone. My [drone]({% link drone-work.md %}) and [bird]({% link the-blog/_posts/2024-07-12-im-a-birder-now.md %}) photography is my sharpest.
