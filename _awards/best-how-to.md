This how-to article regarded a regulatory crackdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission on broker-dealers and their affiliates whose employees used WhatsApp to communicate in their work.

The article explained the implications for banks that are not involved in investment banking --- in particular, what policies these banks should consider about the use of personal devices and accounts for work.

The competition class for this award was regional, including New York-based publications, and based on nominations.
