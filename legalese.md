## what "licensed for exclusive use" means
{:#exclusive-use}

I am not always the copyright holder on photos I use on this website. In these cases, if the work is not licensed for public use, I label it as "licensed for exclusive use".

Common examples on this website of such works include photographs I took for *The Times-Independent*, which [owns the copyright for the work even if I took it]({% link assets/pages/legalese/circ09.pdf %}), and photographs for which *American Banker* purchased a license from Adobe Stock to use.
